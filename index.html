        <h3>Les Arcs</h3>
        This is one of our most popular destinations, based inbetween Marseille and Monaco, this is an 
        exhilarating mountain with multiple resort that has many differents resorts and is family convenient.            
        There are a multitude of winter sports including skiing, snowboarding and hiking. The weather is calm, 
        peaceful and should allow graceful trips and winter long.<br>
        <h3>Client story:</h3>
        Last year one of our clients chose Les Arcs for his families winter holiday. The family went for a week
        skiing and were amased by the vast levels of slopes, from ultra beginner to pro-level. They enjoyed the
        local cuisine and the welcoming atmosphere of the resort, overall they recommended Les Arcs for your next 
        winter holiday!

        <h3>Snowmass</h3>
        This is also one of our most popular destinations, based in colorado USA, It's the second-biggest ski 
        area in Colorado. With 91 downhill trails covering more than 150 miles, and a total of 3,332 skiable 
        acres — a third more skiable terrain than the other three Aspen areas combined — there's a reason locals 
        call this place Snowmassive. And here, size is a good thing.<br>
        <h3>Client Story:</h3>
        3 months ago a client of ours went to Snowmass on a solo ski trip and said it was some of the best times
        in her life. She said Snowmass is a great place to meet people of all levels, and that the mountains trail
        choices were endless. She recommends highly to anyone looking for a snow holiday.
