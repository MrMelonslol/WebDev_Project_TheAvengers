            Thank you for choosing my website Winter Wonderscapes to search for you're next winter holiday. Here
            you will learn a bit about myself and my life on the snow!<br>
            I am 26 years old and was born in a town in colorado, and a 20 minute drive one of the best snow resorts
            in America. I started snowboarding when I was 3 years old and have won many awards at various competitions
            across the world.<br>
            I obtained my snowboarding instructor certificate when I was just 16 and have been helping people learn ever
            since. I created this website in order to reach a broader audience to help that I couldn't reach before.<br>
